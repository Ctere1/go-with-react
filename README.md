## ℹ️ Introduction

Basic [React](https://react.dev/)-[GO](https://go.dev/) based web app skeleton for now (it can transform to a project)

It has a live-reloading function (AIR). You do not have to run build command every time for your React app also     


At the end of the day get binary build that holds backend and frontend together (GO Embed Feature)
